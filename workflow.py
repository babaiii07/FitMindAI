When you receive user details, first consider if the 'research_agent' needs to be invoked to gather more information related to the user's goal, diet, or health conditions before the 'plan_agent' can create a comprehensive plan.\n2. After research, ensure all relevant user data and research findings are available in the messages before handing off to the 'plan_agent'.\n3. The 'plan_agent' will then generate the final personalized plan. Your FINAL output to the user MUST be ONLY the generated plan from the 'plan_agent', without any additional conversational text or preambles from yourself. Ensure the plan is complete and well-formatted. Do not do any work yourself beyond orchestrating the agents and presenting the final plan."""
